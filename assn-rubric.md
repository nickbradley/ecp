## Q1 (out of 5 marks)
0 marks if student agrees and only provides justification to support agreement.

+1 if the student clearly states that they do NOT agree: this is a yes or no response.
+2 for each of the following justifications being present in the students response:
  - test suite confirms that the implementation adheres to the specification
  - test suite provides protection from regressions when changing the system
  - systematically translating the specification into test cases could help identify missing or incomplete behaviours
+1 if the solution mentions risk mitigation but doesn't eloborate on what risk and how the test suite help mitigate the risk

## Q2.A (out of 8 marks)

+1 for identifying each test case that is missing from the test suite. Student responses can be in the form of test cases or descriptions. For test cases, be sure that they are not redundant with the existing cases.

## Q2.B (out of 4 marks)

+1 for identifying each test case in the solution.

## Q2.C (out of 1 mark)

+1 if the response explicitly states the `isValidEmail` uses `<` instead of `<=`.

## Q2.D (out of 1 mark)

+1 if the student response mentions ambiguity in the domain specification.

## Q3 (out of 25 marks)

Autograded.
